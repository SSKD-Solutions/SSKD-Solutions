blurb: |
    I'm a passionate engineer and researcher who thrives on turning complex ideas 
    into innovative solutions. I specialize in AI, software development, and cutting-edge wireless 
    communication systems, but what truly drives me is creating meaningful impact through my work and 
    helping others succeed. <br><br>

    I’ve had the privilege of contributing to impactful projects in both academia and industry. 
    My current PhD research focuses on AI-native air interfaces for 6G wireless communications - a field at 
    the forefront of tomorrow's technology. This work combines my love for problem-solving with my entrepreneurial 
    spirit, as I’m deeply committed to translating research into real-world innovations.<br><br>

    Beyond my technical work, I believe in the power of community. Through my involvement with IET and IEEE, 
    I’ve organized events like the ‘Future of Our Roads’ and judged the IET FIRST LEGO League to inspire the 
    next generation of engineers. These experiences have been some of the most rewarding in my career, 
    as they’ve allowed me to share knowledge, collaborate with talented individuals, and give back to the engineering community. <br><br>

    I’m also passionate about creating opportunities for others to grow. Whether it’s mentoring, volunteering, or 
    collaborating on exciting projects, I’m always looking for ways to make a difference. Together with my co-founder, 
    we’ve built a consultancy that blends AI, software, and hardware expertise to others tackle their toughest challenges and bring their 
    visions to life. <br><br>

   <strong>Let’s connect—I’d love to hear your story and explore how we can create something extraordinary together!<strong>
